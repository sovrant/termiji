This project is still in process

This project is about an Emoji picker in terminal.

I've decided to make this project because I have problems trying to quickly access emojis, I know there are other emoji picker apps out there
however all of them are bloated and UI based application which is slow and kinda of an overkill for me so I've created this project to fix that issue

The features:
1.Text based UI
2.Real time searching
3.UI scaling to terminal size(so the user will be able to set their own terminal size when launched to use the app as a quick access)

I am planning to split the project's files into four files: main.rs, UI.rs, input.rs, emoji.rs
